Download all songs from imported spotify playlist at fildo.net


First, go to http://fildo.net

There you can download your songs from your spotify playlist once imported. 
You can download each song, however, currently there's no option where you can download all songs in the selected playlist.

This is where this Chrome extension comes in. 
Once the playlist is selected, it'll automatically download all the songs and be saved in the downloads directory.
